=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Repsite::CommandLine;

    # run under a local interface (on the server)
    Repsite::CommandLine->run({
        api_meta => 'Some::Class',
    });

    # Also on the server
    Repsite::CommandLine->run({
        api_meta => {  # will use Repsite::Base
            methods => {
                foo => sub { return {FOO => 1} },
            },
        },
    });


    # run under a remote interface (on a client)
    use Repsite::CommandLine;
    Repsite::CommandLine->run({
        api_meta => {
            remote  => 1, # will use Repsite::Client
            service => 'foo',
            host    => 'localhost',
            brand   => 'test',
            pass    => '-',
            port    => 50000,
            no_ssl  => 1,
        },
    });


    # it is also possible to use this as a reusable service in other utilities
    my $cmdclient = Repsite::CommandLine->new({api_meta => {service => 'dist', port => 50905, host => 'example.com'}});
    my $data = $cmdclient->run_method(hello => {foo => 1});

    # will prompt for password
    my $data = $cmdclient->run_method(hello => {test_auth => 1});

=item api_meta

May be a class name, or a hashref of information necessary for passing
to Repsite::Base or Repsite::Client.  If it is a classname, it should be
capable of handling run_method (typically should be a subclass of
Repsite::Base).  Otherwise the hashref should conform to the standards for
Repsite::Base.  If a api_meta contains a true value for "remote", then
Repsite::Client will be used instead.
